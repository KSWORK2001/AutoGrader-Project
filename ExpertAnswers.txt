Answer 1: The "Architectural Efficiency" Approach
The primary way GPUs and TPUs accelerate AI development is by shifting from the CPU's latency-optimized architecture to a throughput-optimized architecture. While a CPU consists of a few dozen powerful cores designed to handle complex, sequential logic and branching, GPUs and TPUs utilize thousands of smaller, specialized cores. This massive parallelism is essential because deep learning requires performing the same mathematical operation on millions of data points simultaneously.

Furthermore, AI models rely heavily on matrix multiplication and vector addition. GPUs (using Tensor Cores) and TPUs (using Systolic Arrays) are hardware-accelerated to perform these specific calculations in a single clock cycle, whereas a CPU would require many cycles to achieve the same result. Finally, GPUs and TPUs utilize High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which provides significantly wider data paths than standard CPU RAM, preventing the processor from sitting idle while waiting for data.
