Answer 3: The "Computational Throughput" Approach
The advantage of GPUs and TPUs over CPUs lies in their ability to maximize computational throughput for parallelizable tasks. Deep learning training involves repetitive matrix multiplications that do not require the complex branch prediction or out-of-order execution logic found in modern CPUs. By stripping away this general-purpose complexity, GPUs and TPUs can pack thousands of simple processing cores onto a single chip, allowing them to process entire tensors (multi-dimensional data arrays) simultaneously rather than sequentially.

Beyond just core count, the memory architecture is a critical differentiator. The "Von Neumann bottleneck"—where the processor waits for data to arrive from memory—is a major issue for CPUs in AI tasks. GPUs and TPUs mitigate this by using stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) integrated directly near the compute die. This combination of specialized arithmetic hardware and massive memory bandwidth allows AI models to be trained in hours or days, a process that would otherwise take months on a CPU-based system.
